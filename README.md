# HR Analytics – Employee Attrition & Performance Prediction (Data Mining Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive **Data Mining and Machine Learning project** focused on:

- **Predicting whether employees will leave the company (Attrition Prediction)**
- **Analyzing employee performance patterns**
- **Identifying key factors contributing to regrettable attrition**

The project was developed as part of a **Data Mining course**, following an **iterative and analytical workflow**, from raw data exploration to final predictive modeling and evaluation.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze HR data to understand employee behavior and performance
- Predict employee attrition using classical machine learning models
- Compare multiple modeling approaches using consistent evaluation metrics
- Perform feature engineering and iterative model optimization
- Provide interpretable and reproducible results suitable for academic evaluation

---

## 🧠 Methodology
The project follows a structured data mining pipeline:

1. **Raw Data Inspection & Sanity Checks**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
4. **Feature Engineering**
5. **Baseline Modeling**
6. **Iterative Hyperparameter Tuning**
7. **Final Evaluation & Reporting**

All experiments are implemented in Jupyter Notebooks with clear separation of concerns.
